# 2-Phase Bipolar Stepper Motor PCB Design

This repository contains the PCB design for controlling a 2-phase bipolar stepper motor using a **L297** and **L298** driver ICs. The design ensures precise motor control by efficiently managing current flow to the stepper motor phases.

## Features
- **L297 & L298 ICs** for stepper motor control
- Designed for **2-phase bipolar stepper motors**
- Easy-to-use, customizable PCB layout
- Supports various stepper motor configurations

## Components Used
- **L297**: Stepper motor controller IC
- **L298**: Dual H-Bridge motor driver IC
- Capacitors, resistors, and other passive components

## Installation
1. Load the provided PCB design files into a PCB design software.
2. Manufacture the PCB using your preferred method (e.g., online PCB fabrication or DIY).
3. Solder the components as per the design.

## Usage
- Connect the PCB to a 2-phase bipolar stepper motor and control it via the appropriate stepper motor driver signals.
- Adjust configurations based on the application (e.g., current limit settings, motor type).
